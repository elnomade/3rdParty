3rdParty
========
This project is a collection of C++ libraries that I have used in the past and found useful.

Main target is Windows with Visual Studio 2010 or above.

The idea is to have a preset configuration to use each library in one's project.

--------------

Pre-requisites
==============
The source code of each library is to be provided by the user.

Usage
=====
Visual Studio's .props files are the chosen way to accomplish this, you should simply add any of the existing .props files and be ready to use your chosen library.

Building
========
Optionally, a common enough build configuration may be included for each library if that makes sense.
